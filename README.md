# project5
The project is all about reading a csv file of terrorism around the world and create a graph showing
  #The country that has been attacked the most in the worl (only choose Uk, US, and Japan) during a period of time
  #Showing their attacking styles (Bombing/explosion and assasination)
  #Showing the attacing target (Military, Police, Business)



The CSV file is too huge so I added it to the .gitignore, but there is a copy of it in the zip file I submitted.
